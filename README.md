# Usage:
`monitour` shows date, time and weather by default. `clock` is a wrapper, perfectly suited towards running on a small terminal in i3wm or on quake mode in tilix.

Set your location as `temp_location`.

# Installation:
`pip install -r requirements.txt` is needed for python requests.
To run `clock` comfortably you need to put it in your PATH, e.g. in `/usr/bin`.
